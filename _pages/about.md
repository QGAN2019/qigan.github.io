I am currently in the final year of my PhD, with a background in machine learning, computer vision, and their interdisciplinary applicationsâ€”particularly in the analysis and interpretation of human motion. My recent research focuses on bridging cutting-edge AI techniques with real-world sports performance analysis and biomechanical insights. I am especially passionate about developing interpretable, data-efficient models that can extract meaningful patterns from complex motion data. With a strong foundation in both theoretical understanding and practical implementation, I thrive at the intersection of science and engineering, where I work to create robust, insightful tools that contribute to both research and real-world applications.
