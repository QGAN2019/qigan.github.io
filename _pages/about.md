I completed my PhD in LTCI of Télécom Paris, Institut Polytechnique de Paris (IP Paris). In my PhD project, I co-work with Prof. [Stephan Clémençon](https://perso.telecom-paristech.fr/clemenco/), [Sao Mai Nguyen](http://nguyensmai.free.fr/Home.html), Prof. [Mounîm El-Yacoubi](https://elyacoubi.wp.imt.fr/), [Eric Fenaux](https://www.linkedin.com/in/eric-fenaux-29013733/) and [Ons Jelassi](https://ojelassi.wp.imt.fr/).

The project focuses on the analysis and interpretation of human motions with a particular interest in sports-related motions. We investigated computer vision methods for estimating human poses from sports competition videos and eXplainable AI (XAI) methods for the interpretation of human movements.

I am currently actively pursuing postdoctoral opportunities.
