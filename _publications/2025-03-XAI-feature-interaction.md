Recent advances in interpretable machine learning methods enable the analysis of feature contributions to machine learning model predictions. However, such interpretations can be misleading when there is feature interaction. Modeling feature interactions is challenging because the interactions can exist among subgroups of the feature set and at any particular interval of the feature values. Therefore, a functional description of multi-feature interactions is desirable. In this work, we propose a model consisting of independent terms and an interaction term to describe the interactions between a particular feature and the other features. Based on this model, we derive a method to estimate the feature interaction term numerically as a matrix. By decomposing this matrix, we obtain vector components that represent functional interactions between a particular feature and the other features. We then propose a method to quantify the interaction strengths between these components based on evaluating their randomness using sample entropy. We evaluated our approach in both simulated and real-world datasets.
