Biomechanical features describing movements and poses of athletes have been proposed by experts to help study athletic performances, but the traditional way of measuring those features are high-cost, time-consuming and intrusive. In this paper, we propose a deep learning-based method that can estimate athletic biomechanical features from typical broadcast competition videos, i.e. single-camera-shot moving videos. This method involves state-of-the-art human pose estimation models and a biomechanical analysis to reconstruct the trajectory. We then leverage the reconstructed trajectory to estimate the target features. To evaluate the method, we gathered a dataset from the long jump World Championships
of 2017 and 2018, comprising 22 expert-proposed long-jump biomechanical features about the trajectories, taking-off and landing characteristics. Our experiments show the effectiveness of the pipeline in automatically estimating the biomechanical features. By analysing the results, we identify the challenges towards high-accuracy athletes’ feature estimations from monocular broadcast competition videos.
